<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This carne asada marinade is our family's favorite — and I've tried many! A 24-hour soak in a spicy citrus and soy marinade ensures your flank steak will be perfectly tender when it comes off the grill.</p>
<h2>Ingridients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>¾ cup orange juice</li>
    <li>½ cup lemon juice</li>
    <li>⅓ cup lime juice</li>
    <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
    <li>... (add more ingredients as needed)</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Step 1</strong></h2>
<ol>
    <li>Combine orange juice, lemon juice, and lime juice for marinade in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add cilantro, soy sauce, garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, chipotle pepper, and oregano; stir to combine.</li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>Step 2</strong></h2>
<ol>
    <li>Slowly <strong>Test</strong> whisk in olive oil until well combined. Remove 1 cup of the marinade and place in a small bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for use after the steak is cooked.</li>
